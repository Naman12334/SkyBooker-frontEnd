SkyBooker — Frontend (Airline Ticket Booking System)
This is the React frontend for SkyBooker, a flight booking platform. It talks to a Spring Boot microservices backend through a single API Gateway at localhost:8080. The app handles everything from searching flights to booking confirmation, and has separate dashboards for airline staff and admins.

Tech Stack
React 18 with React Router DOM v6 for routing. API calls are made using Axios. Auth state is managed globally with React Context API — no Redux or any external state library. Styling is done with plain CSS, one file per component. The project was bootstrapped with Create React App.

Auth and Session
After login, the JWT token is decoded using atob() to extract the role. The token, email, and role are saved to localStorage and loaded into AuthContext. This means the session survives a page refresh — users don't need to log in again.

Logout clears everything from localStorage and resets the context.

ProtectedRoute just checks if a token exists. RoleRoute checks if the token's role matches the required role for that page. Unauthorized users are redirected silently.

Registration
Three roles are available on the register form: Passenger, Airline Staff, and Admin.

Passenger registration has no restrictions — anyone can sign up. When Airline Staff is selected, a Staff Secret Key field appears that must be filled with the key provided by the administrator. Selecting Admin shows a separate Admin Secret Key field instead. The keys are validated on the backend and wrong keys are rejected immediately. This way random users cannot register themselves as staff or admin.

API Layer
All API calls go through src/api/api.js. The gateway URL is set once at the top:

const GATEWAY_URL = 'http://localhost:8080';
The file exports separate objects for each domain — authApi, flightApi, bookingApi, passengerApi, paymentApi, seatApi, airlineApi. Every protected call automatically attaches the Bearer token from localStorage via the authHeader() helper.

Booking Flow
When a user selects a flight from the results page:

They're taken to the seat map (/seats/:flightId)
They pick a seat — it gets held for 15 minutes via the backend
They fill in passenger details
A booking is created — this returns a bookingId
They're redirected to the payment page (/payment/:bookingId)
After paying, the seat is confirmed and they land on the confirmation screen
If the user isn't logged in when they click "Select Flight", they're redirected to /login and brought back to the same seat page after logging in.

Running Locally
Make sure the backend is running first (all 8 services on ports 8080–8087).

npm install
npm start
App runs at http://localhost:3000.

If you want to point the frontend to a different backend, update the gateway URL in src/api/api.js:

const GATEWAY_URL = 'http://your-backend-url';
